Plan

Concerns
  - errors on rails migration pending
  - discovering models
  - only valid models selected

  - only valid attributes selected
  - discovering validations
  - generating valid fake data on validations
  
  - mass / batch style db creation
    - seems making hash of the record, then putting it in holder hash for single
      call works really well
    - alternatively if they aren't the same data you wrap all the calls in 
      a transaction too

Classes
